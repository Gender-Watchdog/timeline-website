        <p>Tokenism refers to the practice of making only a symbolic effort to include a small number of individuals from underrepresented groups to give the appearance of gender equality without achieving genuine diversity in decision-making positions.</p>

        <p>This analysis examines how Dongguk University's Graduate School of Film and Digital Media maintains an all-male faculty in 2025, despite institutional claims of gender equity and diversity policies.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Dongguk University's Graduate School of Film and Digital Media has <strong>zero female professors</strong> as of April 2025</li>
          <li>The absence of female faculty occurs despite the university's public commitment to gender equality</li>
          <li>This gender imbalance creates unique vulnerabilities regarding sexual violence prevention and reporting</li>
          <li>The abolition of the Women's Student Council in 2018 removed a crucial advocacy mechanism for female students</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Missing Female Perspectives</h2>

        <p>The complete absence of women in faculty positions carries significant implications:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Female students lack mentors who understand gender-specific challenges in the film industry</li>
          <li>No female authority figures to whom students might comfortably report sexual violence</li>
          <li>Decision-making about curriculum, teaching approaches, and student concerns occurs entirely from male perspectives</li>
          <li>Perpetuation of gender bias in hiring practices continues despite public diversity commitments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Structural Impact on Sexual Violence Prevention</h2>

        <p>Research by the Korean Women's Development Institute consistently shows that the absence of female faculty correlates with higher rates of sexual violence and poorer institutional responses in Korean universities. The lack of female professors at Dongguk serves as a critical structural risk factor for sexual violence, particularly given:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The abolition of the Women's Student Council during the height of Korea's MeToo movement</li>
          <li>No visible independent mechanisms for reporting sexual violence</li>
          <li>The power dynamics between the exclusively male faculty and predominantly female student body</li>
          <li>Proximity to commercial film entities that share space with the academic program</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Safety Implications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Absence of role models for female students in film/media</li>
          <li>No female authority figures to whom students might comfortably report sexual violence</li>
          <li>Limited perspective in curriculum development and teaching approaches</li>
          <li>Perpetuation of male-dominated industry practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Institutional Gaps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No Women's Student Council since its abolishment in 2018</li>
          <li>No gender studies department or courses addressing gender in media</li>
          <li>No visible independent mechanisms for reporting sexual violence</li>
          <li>No public sexual violence prevention policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>

        <p>For meaningful change, Dongguk University should:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Implement transparent hiring practices with explicit diversity goals</li>
          <li>Reinstate the Women's Student Council or establish equivalent advocacy mechanisms</li>
          <li>Create independent reporting channels for sexual violence that bypass the all-male faculty structure</li>
          <li>Publish clear goals and timelines for achieving faculty gender balance</li>
          <li>Engage international partner universities to review exchange agreements until these structural issues are addressed</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>While many academic institutions struggle with gender balance, Dongguk University's Graduate School of Film and Digital Media presents a particularly concerning case with its complete absence of female faculty combined with the dismantling of student advocacy structures. This situation requires urgent attention, especially given the program's international exchange partnerships and reputation as Korea's leading film school.</p>
