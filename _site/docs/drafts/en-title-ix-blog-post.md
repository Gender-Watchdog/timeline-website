**Subject: Title IX Risk Advisory --- Structural Harassment Exposure at
Dongguk University (Seoul)**

Dear Office of Title IX Compliance / Office of Global Programs,

We wish to submit a risk advisory concerning Dongguk University's
graduate film program in Seoul, South Korea --- a program currently
listed as a partner institution by several U.S. universities.

There is substantial reason to believe that the program exposes female
graduate students to persistent, structurally embedded risks of sexual
harassment, operating within a male-dominated institutional culture that
lacks independent reporting systems, protective oversight, or gender
balance in faculty representation.

Such environments not only enable sexual harassment, but **amplify its
psychological and physiological impact by denying women safe pathways
for disclosure or protection**. In this case, the **absence of
transparent support structures**, combined with the individual\'s
prolonged symptoms and withdrawal, likely intensified the distress into
physical collapse --- a pattern consistent with what trauma psychology
defines as **institutional betrayal trauma**.

**Institutional Risk Factors at Dongguk University:**

-   No visible, independent reporting system for sexual misconduct

-   Zero full-time female faculty in the graduate film program

-   Abolition of the Women's Student Council during the height of
    > Korea's MeToo movement (2018)

-   Shared campus space with commercial film entities (e.g., Sidus FNH),
    > blurring lines between academic authority and industry power
    > dynamics

These factors combine to create a statistically high-risk environment
for gender-based harm, particularly in a country where --- according to
a 2021 study by the Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) --- arts
graduate programs are among the highest-risk environments for sexual
violence by faculty.

**🧾 Confirmed Cases of Institutional Misrepresentation**

Despite these red flags, Dongguk continues to publicly list a wide range
of U.S., Canadian, and European universities as partners on its official
website: 👉 <https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554>\
📎 Archived April 8, 2025:
<https://web.archive.org/web/20250317141009mp_/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554>

We have contacted several of these institutions directly. Two examples
are especially troubling:

🇨🇦 **Canada:**

"We do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University. As
a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and when
you communicate with any journalists or media."

🇺🇸 **United States:**

"Greetings,\
Thank you for making us aware of this situation. We are undergoing a
review of all of our exchange partners and will take this into
consideration and will reach out to our partners at Dongguk
accordingly.\
Please do not quote me in any articles or further emails. Thank you.\
Best,"

These responses confirm that some schools currently listed by Dongguk
have **no active relationship with the university**. This suggests
possible **false advertising of partnerships**, which may distort public
rankings and mislead international applicants.

📊 **Response from a Global University Rankings Organization:**

"Hello,\
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We\'ve forwarded this to
our management for their attention.\
Kind regards,"

This shows that international institutions are taking the matter
seriously and are reviewing Dongguk's credibility and safety record.

**Recommendation:**

We respectfully recommend that your office:

-   Review Dongguk University's standing as a current or prospective
    > exchange partner

-   Contact their global programs office to formally request
    > documentation of student safety protocols and harassment response
    > mechanisms

-   Suspend exchange programs until a full Title IX compliance
    > assessment is completed and independent protections for students
    > can be verified
