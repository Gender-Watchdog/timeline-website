            <strong>🚨 BREAKING INVESTIGATION:</strong> New Freedom of Information (FOI) requests confirm that Dongguk University has been claiming partnerships with top Western universities that do not exist. We believe these fake "Global Network" claims were used to trick Tsinghua University into signing an MOU.
        </div>

        <h2>The "Tsinghua Trap": Did Dongguk Use Fakes to Impress the Elite?</h2>
        <p>In December 2025, Dongguk University proudly announced an MOU with <strong>Tsinghua University</strong>, China's top academic institution. The Dean of the Film School posed for photos, likely presenting Dongguk as a "Global Hub" with partners in the UK and Canada.</p>

          <p><em>The Signing Ceremony: Did Tsinghua know Dongguk's "Global Network" was built on lies?</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>But that "Global Hub" status is a fabrication. We have now confirmed that at least two of their prestigious "partners"—the University of Southampton (UK) and the University of British Columbia (Canada)—have <strong>no relationship</strong> with Dongguk.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Evidence #1: University of Southampton (UK)</h2>
        <p>Dongguk lists the University of Southampton (a Russell Group university) as a partner. We filed a Freedom of Information request to verify this.</p>
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Southampton confirmed they have <strong>no agreement</strong> with Dongguk University.</p>

          <p><em>Official FOI Response: "No agreement with Dongguk University exists."</em></p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>Evidence #2: University of British Columbia (Canada)</h2>
        <p>The investigation into the University of British Columbia (UBC) reveals a pattern of evasion. It took a government intervention to get the truth.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The Request</h3>
        <p>We asked for any records of communication between UBC and Dongguk for a full year (Sept 2024 - Sept 2025).</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-4">

        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: The Evasion</h3>
        <p>UBC delayed their response, claiming a "backlog" and refusing to provide a timeline.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: The Government Intervention</h3>
        <p>We appealed to the BC Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner (OIPC). They intervened, forcing UBC to respond.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Step 4: The Proof (Zero Records)</h3>
        <p><strong>The Final Verdict:</strong> UBC produced <strong>zero records</strong>. No emails. No agreements. No communication for a full year. A partnership cannot exist without communication.</p>

        <h2>The "Taxpayer Fraud" Connection</h2>
        <p>Dongguk University receives government funding based on its "Global University" status. By inflating their partner list with prestigious names like Southampton and UBC, they are not just misleading students—they are potentially defrauding the Korean taxpayer.</p>

        <p>When Dongguk University lists institutions as "partners" that have officially denied any relationship, this raises grave concerns about whether they have secured government subsidies through false claims.</p>

        <p>Korean taxpayers deserve to know: Has Dongguk University been securing government funds by misrepresenting their international partnerships? One Canadian university has already denied any partnership, while several American universities are currently reevaluating their relationships due to Title IX concerns regarding sexual violence risks.</p>

        <p>We call on the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation of Korea to investigate whether taxpayer money has been allocated based on Dongguk University's demonstrably false partnership claims.</p>

        <p>Dongguk claims to have 381 partner universities, but this number is suspicious as we already know the actual count is 380. One Canadian university on their downloadable partner list has officially denied any partnership with Dongguk. Since there are only 7 Canadian universities on the list, it would not be difficult to contact all of them to verify if they are actual partners and correct the list to 6—or fewer if other universities also deny partnerships.</p>

        <p>However, Dongguk University continues to falsely display this information on their English website and in archived versions. Dongguk University responded to our email on April 6th, so they have been aware of this fact since at least April 7th or 8th when we published a blog post stating that a Canadian university denied the partnership. They've had 25 days to update their website and downloadable partner list but have chosen not to do so.</p>

        <p>Is this incompetence, dishonesty, an act of resistance, or all of the above? Either way, it appears illegal. It's possible that other universities may also deny partnerships. Additionally, more universities are likely to reevaluate their partnerships due to Title IX sexual violence risks at Dongguk University.</p>

        <p>Another peculiar point is that Dongguk University's Korean partner university list shows 7 Canadian universities, while the English website shows only 5. Yet both lists include the university that denied the partnership. What does this inconsistent information mean? Is presenting different content in different languages a deliberate strategy to convey different messages to government officials and foreign universities? This may suggest larger issues related to funding.</p>

        <p>As of May 2nd, Dongguk is still claiming 381 partner universities on their website, including the Canadian university that has officially denied any partnership. This false information could affect government funding decisions.</p>

        <p>Below are direct links to email responses from international partners and organizations, confirming the denial or review of partnerships with Dongguk University:</p>

        <h2>Compare Dongguk's Partner University Listings</h2>

        <p>Despite being notified and given ample time to correct their public information, Dongguk University has not updated their website. Readers can compare the archived and current versions below:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554" target="_blank">Archived Dongguk Partner University List (April 8, 2025)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554" target="_blank">Current Dongguk Partner University List</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both versions still list the same information, indicating Dongguk is hoping the issue will disappear without taking corrective action.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Interestingly, our blog views surged to 21 on April 8th, just two days after we notified Dongguk about Title IX structural sexual violence risks. Since then, they have not responded to our emails, and there appears to be no access to our blog from them. Due to Title IX issues at Dongguk University, more international partners are reviewing their relationships, which, along with false partnership claims, raises serious questions about the university's credibility.</p>
