        <p>In 2007, <strong>Dongguk University</strong> drew international attention over a scandal that would come to be known as <strong>"Shingate."</strong> At its center was <strong>Shin Jeong-ah</strong>, a professor hired in 2005 to teach art history based on what was later discovered to be a <strong>forged Yale University Ph.D.</strong></p>

        <p>Despite internal doubts, Dongguk proceeded with her hire. Crucially, the university had received a <strong>faxed confirmation</strong> from Yale — later revealed to be sent in error — that verified Shin's claimed credentials. When the controversy resurfaced in 2007, Yale initially denied having sent the confirmation, only to later acknowledge it had made a mistake.</p>

        <p>Dongguk, facing reputational fallout, filed a <strong>$50 million defamation lawsuit</strong> in U.S. federal court. The university claimed that Yale's error damaged its ability to attract <strong>government grants, alumni donations, and support for a new law school</strong> initiative <a href="https://yalealumnimagazine.org/articles/2051-korean-university-sues-yale-for-50-million" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p>

        <p>The court dismissed the case. In 2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that Dongguk <strong>failed to prove actual malice or causation of damages</strong>, and Yale was not held liable <a href="https://casetext.com/case/dongguk-univ-v-yale-univ" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>

        <h2>From Legal Accountability to Institutional Responsibility</h2>

        <p>What this episode demonstrated is that Dongguk University clearly <strong>understands how the U.S. legal system works</strong>. It understands that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic integrity</strong> matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Institutional reputation</strong> is shaped by how wrongdoing is handled.</li>
          <li>U.S. legal channels exist not only to protect reputations, but also to demand accountability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Yet today, more than a decade after the Shingate lawsuit, Dongguk faces renewed scrutiny — not over a forged degree, but over its <strong>handling of sexual violence risk, gender equity, and institutional transparency</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>A Growing Concern: Structural Risks in Film Education</h2>

        <p>At the time of writing, Dongguk University:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Has <strong>no female faculty</strong> in its <strong>Graduate School of Film and Digital Media</strong>, despite its co-educational enrollment.</li>
          <li>Maintains <strong>close relationships with production companies</strong>, such as <strong>Sidus FNH</strong>, that <strong>share building space</strong> with graduate classrooms — without clear firewalls, independent oversight, or trusted reporting mechanisms for abuse.</li>
          <li>Has <strong>not implemented Title IX-aligned protections</strong> for its own students — despite having <strong>ongoing academic partnerships with U.S. and Canadian institutions</strong>, whose students may be put at similar risk abroad.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These issues matter because <strong>Title IX</strong>, passed in the U.S. in 1972, guarantees that <strong>students in educational institutions must not face discrimination on the basis of sex</strong> — including <strong>sexual violence, coercion, or abuse by faculty or affiliated personnel</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Double Standard</h2>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>Dongguk University was willing to invoke U.S. legal protections when its <strong>reputation and funding were on the line</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But now, when <strong>U.S. values</strong> — like <strong>gender equity, anti-harassment measures, and student safeguards</strong> — are relevant to how it manages its own programs, the university has gone quiet.</p>

        <p>This isn't just a legal oversight. It's a case of <strong>selective institutional ethics</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Irony: Reputational Harm Then — And Now</h2>

        <p>In its lawsuit against Yale, Dongguk claimed the "Shingate" incident caused it to lose credibility, threatening its ability to secure <strong>alumni donations, charitable gifts, and institutional growth</strong>.</p>

        <p>But today, it is knowingly ignoring <strong>documented structural vulnerabilities for sexual violence</strong> — vulnerabilities that carry <strong>far greater reputational and legal risk</strong> than the forgery scandal ever did.</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>The reputational harm they once feared was hypothetical.<br>
          The reputational harm they now face is real — and global.<br>
          And this time, <strong>they cannot blame anyone else</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <hr>

        <h2>Time to Reaffirm Core Values</h2>

        <p>As this international advocacy campaign gathers momentum, Dongguk University must ask itself:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Will it <strong>modernize its hiring practices</strong> to reflect gender balance and fair representation?</li>
          <li>Will it <strong>establish independent, transparent structures</strong> to address sexual violence and misconduct — especially where academic and industry lines blur?</li>
          <li>Will it <strong>live up to the same standards of integrity and accountability</strong> it once expected from others?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The legacy of Shingate should have been about <strong>learning from institutional failure</strong>.</p>

        <p>If Dongguk continues to evade necessary reform, the message is clear:<br>
        <strong>It has learned nothing at all.</strong></p>
