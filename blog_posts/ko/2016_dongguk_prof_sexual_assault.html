# Media Communication Professor Prosecuted for Sexual Violence (2016)

This archival report documents a significant case from 2016 that represents part of the pattern of sexual violence issues at Dongguk University.

## Original News Report

On September 20, 2016, a professor from Dongguk University's Media Communication Major was prosecuted for indecent assault. The incident had occurred in November 2015 when the professor had drinks with a female graduate. A week after the incident, the victim reported the crime to police.

According to police investigations, the professor was found to have forcibly kissed the graduate student and sexually assaulted her. The victim provided evidence including documentation of conversations via social media platforms. 

## Institutional Response

The news report reveals concerning aspects of Dongguk University's institutional response:

1. **Delayed Action**: The university claimed they first learned of the incident in February 2016, but took no immediate disciplinary action.

2. **Awareness Before Action**: Police confirmed that Dongguk University had been aware of the issue during the investigation, as there was a record of the professor's background check in their files.

3. **Student Concerns**: Many students expressed doubts about the university's handling of the case, specifically noting the school's failure to take a clear public stance.

4. **Belated Response**: Only after receiving formal verification of the indictment did the university request the professor's resignation from the educational foundation.

## Student Council Response

Kim Nuga, the chairperson of the Media Communication Major's Student Council, stated:

> "We are very sorry for failing to prevent the incident from happening. From now on, we promise to keep an eye on the case and inform everyone in our major about its progress. Also, we are planning to find out whether other rumors about the professor are true or not and discuss about the issue with the Student Councils of other majors."

## Context Within Broader Pattern

This 2016 case further substantiates concerns about:

1. The power dynamics between male professors and female students
2. The university's reactive rather than proactive approach to sexual violence
3. Delays in institutional response that potentially endanger students
4. The role of alcohol (hoesik culture) in creating vulnerable situations
