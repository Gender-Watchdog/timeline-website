        <p><strong>Dongguk University in Seoul</strong>, long regarded as Korea's top graduate school for film, operates a Master's program in Digital Media and Contents that presents <strong>serious structural risk factors for sexual violence</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The faculty is <strong>entirely male</strong></li>
          <li>The program <strong>shares its building</strong> with commercial film entities such as <strong>Sidus FNH</strong></li>
          <li>In 2018, Dongguk <strong>abolished its Women's Student Council</strong> during the height of the MeToo movement</li>
          <li>There are <strong>no visible independent mechanisms</strong> for reporting sexual violence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Despite these red flags, Dongguk continues to promote international exchange programs with multiple institutions worldwide — including several <strong>Canadian and U.S. universities</strong> — via its official website:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554" target="_blank">👉 https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554</a></p>

        <p>🕵️‍♀️ <strong>Archived April 8, 2025:</strong><br>
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554" target="_blank">📎 Web Archive Link</a></p>

        <div class="response-example p-3 border rounded bg-light mb-3">
          <h4>🔻 <strong>Dongguk's only official response to date was</strong>:</h4>
          <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
            <p>"For what purpose did you send the e-mail? Is it for suggestion or reporting?"</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>This reply, sent by Dongguk's <strong>Global Student Team</strong>, was not escalated to any legal, ethics, or Title IX-equivalent office. It suggests <strong>dismissiveness</strong>, not diligence.</p>

        <h3>🎭 Broader Risks: Gender Equity & Institutional Transparency</h3>

        <p>According to research by the <strong>Korean Women's Development Institute</strong>, graduate programs in the arts — especially those tied to the film industry — exhibit <strong>some of the highest rates of sexual violence in Korean higher education</strong>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/BAPF2DA400#4RGLR08iLFAJ" target="_blank">📄 Study: "University Students in the Culture and Arts after the MeToo Movement"</a></p>

        <p>Key patterns include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Structural <strong>silencing of survivors</strong></li>
          <li>Lack of <strong>independent reporting systems</strong></li>
          <li>High prevalence of <strong>retaliation or reputational threats</strong></li>
          <li>Power held exclusively by <strong>male faculty</strong> in career-determining contexts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>❓ Open Questions for the Public and Partner Schools</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Are international students being placed into high-risk environments under the guise of "prestige"?</li>
          <li>Why do some schools appear on partner lists without active agreements?</li>
          <li>What obligations do sending institutions have when host environments are structurally unsafe?</li>
        </ul>
